# ðŸ§  Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis â€“ Data Analyst Internship

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
The goal of this task was to use SQL to analyze a structured dataset by performing various queries, aggregations, joins, and optimization techniques.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
I used a **Customer Support Dataset** that I split into four logical tables and saved as CSVs:

- `customers.csv` â€“ Contains customer city, remarks, and order IDs  
- `orders.csv` â€“ Includes order date, item price, product category, and channel  
- `agents.csv` â€“ Contains agent details, shifts, tenure, and CSAT scores  
- `tickets.csv` â€“ Tracks ticket IDs, categories, subcategories, and timestamps  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **SQLite** for writing and executing SQL queries  
- **DB Browser for SQLite** for data visualization and importing CSVs  
- **GitHub** for version control and task submission

## ðŸ§ª SQL Features Used

### âœ… Step 1: Data Import
All four CSV files were imported into SQLite as relational tables. The tables were structured to allow joins via foreign keys such as `Order_id`.

### âœ… Step 2: SQL Query Execution
I performed a range of queries to analyze data:
- Used `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY` to filter, sort, and group records.
- Used aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()` to analyze spending and performance.
- Applied `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` to combine tables for meaningful insights.
- Wrote subqueries to compare values with calculated averages.

#### âœ… Step 3: Create a View
To simplify repeated queries and make the analysis reusable, I created a SQL view for agent performance based on CSAT scores.

âœ… Step 4: Indexing (Optimization)
To improve performance during filtering and joining operations, I used indexing on frequently accessed fields.

âœ… Conclusion
This project enhanced my practical understanding of SQL for data analysis. By working with a structured, multi-table dataset, I was able to apply key SQL concepts including SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregate functions, subqueries, view creation, and indexing.

Through this hands-on task, I gained deeper insight into how relational databases are used in real-world business scenariosâ€”especially for customer support analysis, performance tracking, and operational reporting.

Overall, this task strengthened my ability to extract, manipulate, and summarize meaningful information from large datasets using SQL in a systematic and efficient way.
